				<p> <span style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: 800;">Y</span>ou crunch in 100 hours of work a day, trying to impress our boss, or thinking that you want to secure top scores in your upcoming exams. But turns out, the opposite happens to you. Either you made some mistakes on your deliverables and your boss yells at you, or you didn’t score the marks you expected. And you will beat yourself up thinking your hard work always goes in vain. But why does this happen? Does that mean <span style="font-weight: 800; color: #3366ff">Hard work will yield success</span> is <span style="font-weight: 800; color: red;">False</span>? Yes, but No. </p>
				<img src="images/boss.jpg" class="bossImage">
				<p>
					You see, <span style="font-weight: 800;">our brain can concentrate well for not more than 30 mins</span>. After that, the potential to concentrate gradually decreases. Even if you put your best in class efforts for 2 hours, trying not to get distracted and focus on your work, it turns out the first half-hour will yield best results and energy put into the next one and half hours goes in vain. 
				</p>
				<p>There are a lot of “Scientifically proven” methods available on the internet. They tell us to switch off our phones and be away from all the social media. But there’s this one technique where you can work and be efficient, and at the same time spend some time on social media, without affecting your progress. It’s called the Pomodoro Technique.</p>
				<img src="images/pomodoro.jpeg" class="pomodoroImage">
				<div class="steps">
					<p>
							The technique is as follows.
							<ol>
								<li>You work for <span style="font-weight: 800;">25 mins</span>, without any distractions, and full concentration on the task in hand</li>
								<li>Take a quick <span style="font-weight: 800;"> five-minute</span> break. You can either have some snacks, scroll through your Instagram feed, or you can read my blogs <span style='font-size:1em;'>&#128514;</span> </li>
								<li>Again start with step 1.</li>
								<li>After you completed four ‘25’ min blocks (with those 5 min rests) take a half-hour break. Play some games or do whatever you want that interests you.</li>
								<li>Repeat</li>
							</ol>
						</p>
				</div>
				<p>You can set timers on your laptop or on your phone to remind you after your ‘25 minute’ session. And set a reminder for your breaks as well. The key for maximum throughput is that you have to be conscious and dedicated. </p>
				<p>The next question is, <span style="font-weight: 800;">How did this technique impact my life?</span> I have been using this technique for two months. Now I can complete all my work efficiently, correctly without sacrificing the things that I love. I was able to deliver on my projects within the deadlines and study well. Usually, I waste a lot of time, getting distracted, and lose my concentration. Knowing that I can set boundaries and achieve small targets and complete them in a short burst of time, makes me complete a huge task with ease and be best at it. </p>
