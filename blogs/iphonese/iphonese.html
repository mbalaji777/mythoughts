		<p>Phil Schiller on YouTube be like</p><br>
		<p style="font-family: 'Yellowtail', cursive; padding: 20px; margin: 20px;">This is the new iPhone SE. It is the most advanced compact phone Apple has ever made. It has such a beautiful screen. The hardware in this….</p><br>
		<p>Cut the crap Phil (For those who don’t know who he is, he is the Senior VP of Apple)</p><br>
		<p>Apple has been advertising their products as if it is the best in the business. All these years Android and Windows have been dominating the market, until the 2019 Keynote presentation. Apple has been taking some serious leaps forward in terms of value that you get for what you pay. Although you are paying a premium for their products, the value that you are getting right now is really good. Apple products are yet again proving to be a viable option for consumers.</p><br>
		<p>Apple has released their new iPhone SE a couple of months back. It is so good. Apple has proved “Don’t judge a book by it’s cover” quote with this mobile. Yes it definitely looks like an iPhone 8. And yes, it looks outdated. But what you are getting here is the power of the most expensive iPhone Apple makes. People who need a phone for breezing through everyday tasks, multitasking or need a cheap to enter into the Apple ecosystem can buy this.</p>
		<p>The following are the specifications of the iPhone SE</p>
		<br>
		<ol>
			<li>A13 Bionic Processor</li>
			<li>3 GB of RAM</li>
			<li>4.7" LCD Retina Display</li>
			<li>Touch ID for authentication</li>
			<li>IP67 water resitance</li>
		</ol>
		<br><p>Apple has delivered all the necessary things for an iPhone to survive. So it looks like it's the best deal right? <b>Yes, but No.</b> </p>
		<br>
		<p>You see, the problem is not with the phone itself. It’s where you are getting this phone. Apple has priced this phone at $399. But then, it’s in the USA. The price varies from region to region. In India, it starts at around ₹35000, and goes all the way upto ₹42000. I think it’s a hard sell considering you have way more better options available. For example, the OnePlus 7T starts at ₹35000. It is miles better than an iPhone SE. It’s still 7 months old, but very capable of all powerful tasks. You can get a refurbished OnePlus 7 Pro for less than ₹40000. It is one of the best phones available on the market right now. </p><br>
		<p><b>My final thought is that, before getting hyped up about the cost of the cheapest iPhone, look at the price at your region. If it's comparable, go ahead and get it. Or else, I would look at other options that are way better than the iPhone SE. </b></p>
		<p>Thanks a ton for reading guys, I hope you liked it!</p>
